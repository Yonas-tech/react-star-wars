# React Star Wars API

In this project I used the Star WArs API ([SWAPI](https://swapi.dev)).
The data fetched from the API is then processed using useState and useEffect to render the ships data into their own card on the webpage. 

When the user clicks the next and previous buttons, the desplay below changes respectively.
